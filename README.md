Here you'll find the talks I've given / were going to give (rip railsconf2015 :( ).

These talks use a variety of tools: Deckset (paid app), [mdp](https://github.com/visit1985/mdp), [remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark) (thanks [Aaron](https://github.com/alkrauss48)!), sometimes just KeyNote. I've also used [keycastr](https://github.com/keycastr/keycastr) to show my commands for the vim-stuff.
