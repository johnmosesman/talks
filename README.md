Here you'll find the talks I've given / were going to give (rip railsconf2015 :( ).

These talks either use Deckset (paid app) or [mdp](https://github.com/visit1985/mdp) or [remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark) (thanks [Aaron](https://github.com/alkrauss48)!), a presenter for the terminal. I also use [keycastr](https://github.com/keycastr/keycastr) to show my commands for the vim-stuff.
