# Why should you become a developer? (why not?)
## Practical reasons
### Salary
#### software creates efficiency and scale

### Market
#### Technology is everywhere (smart fridge)
#### Tools and methods will change, but programming will remain (short of a super AI)

### Bootstrap potential
### Path is visible - hard work, but not hard

## Personal reasons
### Creation
#### Creativity is part of being human
#### Creativity is art, process, business

### Domainless
#### Programming is a tool
#### Apply the tool to what you know
#### Grow your mental processing ability - see the forest and the trees

## Why not?

### You don't like computers (not don't understand--don't like)
### You don't like desk jobs
### You don't like to learn new things

## Notable exclusion

### Not good at math
### Not "smart"

## What skills / traits do you need?
### Just one: raw determination

### My story
#### First exposed freshman year of CS degree at OU
#### completely lost
#### after year two had some basics
#### graduated, got first job and was completely lost again
#### second job, realized I had actually learned some things
#### third job, not stumped as often, or for as long

### you can do it -- just be better today than you were yesterday

## Skills you don't need
### "tech-savvy"
### Good at math and science
### CS degree - welder vs material scientist

### It just takes hard work--a lot of it. It's not "hard", but it is hard work.

#### The web is evolving quickly, and there's an increasing amount to learn.

## What kind of developer?

### Musician analogy - jazz? bit of everything? bass in a jazz trio or electric guitar in a rock band

### Music has genres and instruments, software development has application types and programming languages.

### Jazz, pop, classical - types of software
#### Websites - Space jam
#### Webapps - interactive
#### Mobile apps
#### IOT 

### => Choose webapps - you can make anything else

## What kind of development?

### "The Stack" 
### Frontend

> Most apps today are really just a pretty presentation layer—they’re not doing a lot of processing or computing. The app requests data (like all of your Facebook posts) and presents it to you in a nice feed, and sends data back to the server (like when you post a picture of your coffee).

> The frontend handles requesting data, presenting data, interacting with users, and sending the user’s data and actions back to the server. Frontend developers are concerned with how the app looks, feels, and interacts.

### Backend

> The “backend” is everything you don’t see in the app: servers, network requests, and databases. The backend is responsible for storing and retrieving data, authenticating users, and communicating with other apps and servers. It’s the substance that powers the frontend.

### Expert or generalist - top violinist or person that can jam out to anything => generalist at first
#### Develop the top of your "T"

### So frontend or backend? => Yes (Both)

### You can specialize later on, but knowledge of other subjects make you better at what you do

### Also gives you a chance to try things out and see what you like

## How do you actually become a developer?

### Pick a tool (pokemon starters ref)
### There are many programming languages, and you really can't go wrong picking one at this stage in your career.
### => Running raises your bench
### __All experience is good experience__

### Choose your build later

### So what language_s_
### The tools of the web: HTML, CSS, Javascript, and <backend-language-of-choice>

### Disclaimer: I am about to give you a biased opinion.
### Second disclainer: Do not heed the advice of anyone who does not give a similar disclaimer.

### I *normally* tell people to start with Ruby* (I will explain the asterisk later on)
### Look for a language that is:
#### Stable (been around for a while)
#### Has a well-adopted by the community web framework or web tools
#### Answers to problems are easily found online
#### Stable but still being actively progressed and maintained

#### Ruby, Python, Javascript, Node, Java, ASP.NET, even PHP to an extent
#### (Yes I know Node is not a "language" per say)

### => Just pick a tool you can build web things with

## You've picked a language

### 1) Become familiar with the syntax - learn the letters before you try to make sentences and essays (codeschool, treehouse)
### 2) Make CRUD apps (go through a book, or build dumb apps like a blog)
#### The Rails book 

### 3) Learn concepts outside of CRUD apps
#### https://github.com/johnmosesman/after_the_rails_book/blob/master/after_the_rails_book.md

### 4) Repeat 1-3

## Getting the first job

### This is honestly the hardest part 
#### Quote ryan quoting me

## Things to do before you look for a job

### Get a social developer presence
#### Twitter - tweet about development things, follow development people, tweet about what you're learning, RT new framework releases for free karma -- social proof that you are in the software field
### Blog/personal website - if you don't have one already, build this using a static site generator (jekyll) or backend framework of your choice (more social proof). Blog about what you are learning. "Write to you from 6 months ago."
### Attend meetups like a fiend and "network" - give lightning talks!!
### OSS - looks good on your github
#### FIX TYPOS IN DOCUMENTATION!!!!!
#### If you're using something and it doesn't do what you do, open an issue, and offer to make a PR.
### Have a github 
### Try to answer things on stackoverflow
### Make as many stupid apps as possible. Like as many as possible. Dozens.

## Back to getting the first job

### Again this is the hard part, but if you're done all of the stuff previously you have a higher chance of having a network connection and having grown your skill.
### Use a recruiter. Ask them what kind of jobs are out there. What technologies do they use?

### Use all of the information out there on how to apply for jobs -- where to look, how to make resumes, interview skills, cover letters, etc.

### Tap Your Network™
#### Talk to people you know in the community, ask what jobs are available, ask for help prepping for jobs or interviews

### Back to the asterisk*
#### I normally tell people to use ruby...beginner-friendly language yet elegant enough to be a career-defining language, rails answers are everywhere
#### But I will concede that in Oklahoma City, you probably have a higher likelihood of getting job in Java, Javascript/Node/Angular/React, or ASP.NET then you do in Ruby.
#### However, in my personal biased opinion, I think the quality of jobs will be higher in an environment that uses Ruby. So it's risk and reward play.

### __Any experience is good experience!!__

### It is probably most effective to change jobs every 2 years for the first 5 or so years.
### (But you don't have to)

## How to be an outstanding junior developer

### Communicate really really really really well.
#### Bad: it errored. the page won't load.
#### Good: Here's what I am trying to do -> here's what I've seen/read/tried -> here's the result. I'm trying to figure out X / Why does X happen if Y?
#### This person is trying to read snippets of your code and decipher the problem, it's hard.
### Hone your Google-fu. Learn the "code words" - "string exists in array javascript" not "how do i find out if a certain string is inside of my array"
#### Paste the exact message into google minus project-specific details
### Work hard to solve issues before asking for help, try to avoid obvious questions.
### __After receiving help, reset the clock and go back to working hard__

### When you get frustrated (and you will), learn how to take a deep breath, take a break, and get back into it. Async brain fixes a lot of problems.

### You will progress faster than you think.

### Last tip: fight off imposter syndrome with a vengenance. 

## What separates a "junior" developer from a "senior" developer?

### Yes the senior has more knowledge
### The senior has a system in place to quickly diagnose and fix problems.
### The senior still makes just as many mistakes as the junior--but they are exponentially faster at fixing them.
### A good senior dev's main focus will be cultivating this debugging ability within you.

## So how do you get good at debugging?

### "When in doubt, print more out." - some wise person

### New programmers tend to thrash wildly changing everything under the sun
#### If there's an error message READ THE ERROR MESSAGE
#### Go to the line it said it errored on!
### Is your function being called?
### Is the data you're expecting to receive correct?
### Is the result of what you're doing correct?

### Computers are logic machines, don't waste time believing the impossible
#### "It says it's false, but I set it to true so I don't know how it could be false." => This is wasted energy and a poor train of thought. Turn it around: I set this to true, but it is false. 

##### How could that be possible?! vs How could that be possible?

## Take it _one step at a time_.
### New programmers do everything at once and then have to debug complicated and multiple problems. Take it one step at a time and print. it. out.
