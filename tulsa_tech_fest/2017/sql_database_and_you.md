# Why this talk?

- Your app is your data
- Databases are one of the first and almost universal dependencies
- Databases can be one of the first performance bottlenecks
- Data storage and querying is not very intuitive
- Useful knowledge for all types of devs

---

# Talk structure

1. Structuring data for a relational database
2. Querying (SQL)
3. Associations
4. Data integrity
5. Performance

## Databases

_tables, rows, columns_

```
+-------+-----------+------+--------+
| food  | tastiness | cost | health |
+-------+-----------+------+--------+
| sushi |        10 |   10 |      7 |
| pizza |         8 |    5 |      3 |
| salad |         2 |    8 |      9 |
| water |         0 |    0 |     10 |
+-------+-----------+------+--------+
```

---

## What is "good" structure?

- Goal: to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity
- Free from change anomalies

## Database "Normalization"

---

## The Three "Normal Forms"

- Introduced by Dr. Edgar F. Codd
- Meets our goal of "reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity"

---

## 1st Normal Form

"The information is stored in a relational table and each column contains atomic values, and there are not repeating groups of columns."[^1]

```
+-------------+------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| person_name | person_age | pet1_name | pet1_type | pet1_legs | pet2_name | pet2_type | pet2_legs |
+-------------+------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| John        |         26 | Ruby      | Dog       |         4 | Buddy     | Dog       |         4 |
| Susan       |         22 | Pete      | Bird      |         2 |           |           |           |
| Jim         |         30 | Fluffy    | Cat       |         4 |           |           |           |

## 2nd Normal Form

"The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the tableâ€™s primary key."[^1]

```
people
+-------------+------------+--------------+--------------+
| person_name | person_age |  work_place  |  work_phone  |

| Jim         | Pizza Town   | 333-333-3333 |
+-------------+--------------+--------------+
```

---

## 3rd Normal Form

"The table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key."[^1]

_Or_

"Every non-key attribute must provide a fact about the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key, so help me Codd."[^2]

# 2. Querying

---

## Structured Query Language (SQL)

Most modern Database Management Systems (DBMS) adhere to the SQL Standard.

---

## Creating a table

```
CREATE TABLE people (
  first_name VARCHAR,
  last_name  VARCHAR,
  age        INTEGER
)

---

CREATE TABLE
```

---

## Data types

- `CHAR/VARCHAR/TEXT`
- `INTEGER`
- `BOOLEAN`
- `DATE/DATETIME`

---

## SELECT

```
SELECT *
FROM people

---

0 rows
```

(_*_ = all columns)

---

## SELECT

```
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM people

---

0 rows
```

---

## INSERT

```
INSERT INTO people (first_name, last_name, age) VALUES
  ('John', 'Mosesman', 26),
  ('Bob', 'Smith', 40),
  ('Jane', 'Doe', 32)
  
---

INSERT 0 3
```

---

## WHERE

```
SELECT *
FROM people
WHERE first_name = 'John'

---

+------------+-----------+-----+
| first_name | last_name | age |
+------------+-----------+-----+
| John       | Mosesman  |  26 |
+------------+-----------+-----+
```

---

## WHERE

```
INSERT INTO people
SELECT 'John', 'Smith', 100

---

SELECT *
FROM people
WHERE first_name = 'John'

---

+------------+-----------+-----+
| first_name | last_name | age |
+------------+-----------+-----+
| John       | Mosesman  |  26 |
| John       | Smith     | 100 |
+------------+-----------+-----+
```

---

## AND and OR

```
SELECT *
FROM people
WHERE first_name = 'John'
  AND last_name = 'Mosesman'

---

SELECT *
FROM people
WHERE age > 50
  OR age < 20
```

---

## ALTER

```
ALTER TABLE people ADD COLUMN id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY;

---

SELECT *
FROM people
WHERE id = 1

---

+----+------------+-----------+-----+
| id | first_name | last_name | age |
+----+------------+-----------+-----+
|  1 | John       | Mosesman  |  26 |
+----+------------+-----------+-----+
```

---

## UPDATE

```
UPDATE people
SET first_name = 'Jack'
WHERE id = 2

---

UPDATE 1
```

---

## Aggregations

```
SELECT AVG(age) FROM people     -- 49.5

SELECT SUM(age) FROM people     -- 198

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM people     -- 4
```

## JOINs

"Join" two tables together by matching related rows.

```
+-----------+-------------+------------+---------+----------------+-----------+----------+
| people.id | people.name | people.age | pets.id | pets.person_id | pets.name | pets.age |

+-----------+-------------+------------+---------+----------------+-----------+----------+

## Naive JOIN implementation

1. Combine every row from `people` with every row from `pets`
2. Filter out rows that don't match

# 5. Performance

---

## How do we increase performance?

- Process fewer things
- Process things faster

---

## "Sequential Scan"

- Check every row in the table

---

## Indexes

---

## What is an index?

- Pre-computed data structure for efficient targetting of specific rows
- Keeps track of values and where they exist on disk
- Different types, but usually a b-tree (balanced tree)

---

## Many Constraints Use Indexes

- UNIQUE
- PK / FK

---

## Example

```
CREATE TABLE users (
  name VARCHAR,
  email VARCHAR,
  age INTEGER,
  created_at timestamp,
  updated_at timestamp
)

~475k rows

---

Made a copy - `users_2`

---

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ON users (email)
```

---

## Index vs No Index

```
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE email = 'buck@rippin.co'

---

Un-indexed table (users_2)  - ~100ms
Indexed table (users)       - ~1ms
```

---

### Q: How do we know what's actually going on?
## A: View the Query Plan

---

## Query Planner

- Most modern Database Management Systems (DBMS) have a query planner
- Query planner analyzes and optimizes queries based on internal stats it collects

---

## EXPLAIN (No Index)

```

## Drawbacks of Indicies

- Have to be maintained as table changes
- Take up disk space
- Lose their efficiency if they get too big
- Can hurt performance on write-heavy tables
